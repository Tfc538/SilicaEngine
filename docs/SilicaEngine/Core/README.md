### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility and minimal coupling
2. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of templates and strong typing for compile-time safety
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and result types for robust error management
4. **Performance**: Optimized for both development and production use
5. **Extensibility**: Virtual methods and callback systems for customization
6. **Thread Safety**: Clear documentation of thread safety guarantees

### Thread Safety Matrix

| Module | Thread Safety | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Application | Single-threaded | Main application loop only |
| Window | Single-threaded | GLFW callbacks on main thread |
| Input | Thread-safe | Mutex protection for state access |
| Camera | Single-threaded | Designed for main thread use |
| Logger | Thread-safe | spdlog is thread-safe by design |
| Error Handling | Thread-safe | Read-only operations |
| Resource Management | Mixed | See individual module docs |
| Screenshot | Thread-safe | Mutex protection for shared state |

### Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management with smart pointers and automatic cleanup
- **CPU Overhead**: Minimal overhead with compile-time optimizations
- **GPU Integration**: Direct OpenGL integration for maximum performance
- **I/O Operations**: Asynchronous operations where beneficial
- **Debug Features**: Zero overhead in release builds

## Getting Started

### Basic Application Setup

```cpp
#include <SilicaEngine/SilicaEngine.h>

class MyGame : public SilicaEngine::Application {
protected:
    void OnInitialize() override {
        // Initialize your game systems
    }
    
    void OnUpdate(float deltaTime) override {
        // Update game logic
    }
    
    void OnRender() override {
        // Render your game
    }
    
    void OnShutdown() override {
        // Cleanup resources
    }
};

int main() {
    MyGame game;
    return game.Run();
}
```

### Error Handling Example

```cpp
// Using Result template for simple operations
auto result = SilicaEngine::AssetManager::Initialize("assets/");
if (!result) {
    SE_ERROR("Failed to initialize asset manager: {}", result.errorMessage);
    return -1;
}

// Using ErrorResult for detailed error information
auto textureResult = SilicaEngine::AssetManager::LoadTexture("texture.png");
if (!textureResult) {
    auto errorCode = textureResult.errorCode;
    auto category = SilicaEngine::GetErrorCategory(errorCode);
    SE_ERROR("Texture loading failed: {} (Category: {})", 
             textureResult.errorMessage, 
             static_cast<int>(category));
}
```

### Resource Management Example

```cpp
// Load assets with automatic reference counting
auto texture = SilicaEngine::AssetManager::LoadTexture("player.png");
auto shader = SilicaEngine::AssetManager::LoadShader("basic", "basic.vert", "basic.frag");

// Use stable handles for long-term references
auto handle = SilicaEngine::ResourceRegistry::GetInstance().Register(texture.Get(), 
                                                                     SilicaEngine::ResourceType::Texture);

// Assets are automatically cleaned up when no longer referenced
texture.Reset(); // Release reference
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Always check return values from functions that can fail
- Use appropriate error result types for different scenarios
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Handle errors gracefully with fallback options

### Resource Management
- Use RAII principles with smart pointers and scope guards
- Register resources with the ResourceRegistry for stable handles
- Monitor memory usage and cleanup unused assets regularly
- Use dependency tracking for complex asset relationships

### Performance
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use compile-time optimizations (debug vs release builds)
- Profile and optimize based on actual usage patterns
- Leverage async operations for I/O-bound tasks

### Thread Safety
- Follow the documented thread safety guarantees
- Use appropriate synchronization for shared resources
- Avoid cross-thread access to single-threaded modules
- Consider using async patterns for background operations

- **Assets**: Uses resource management for asset loading and caching
- **Physics**: Receives input and camera data for physics simulation
- **Audio**: Uses resource management for audio file loading

## Future Enhancements

The Core modules are designed for extensibility and future enhancements:

- **Networking**: Integration with networking systems
- **Scripting**: Support for script-based configuration and behavior
- **Profiling**: Enhanced performance monitoring and profiling
