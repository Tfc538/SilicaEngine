# SilicaEngine Documentation

Welcome to the SilicaEngine documentation! SilicaEngine is a modern, high-performance game engine built with C++ and OpenGL, designed for creating 2D and 3D applications with enterprise-grade features.

## Overview

SilicaEngine provides a robust foundation for game development with comprehensive error handling, resource management, debugging tools, and performance profiling capabilities. The engine is designed with modularity, thread safety, and performance in mind.

## Key Features

### Core Systems
- **Application Management**: Centralized application lifecycle management
- **Window Management**: Cross-platform window creation and management
- **Input System**: Multi-platform input handling with callback support
- **Camera System**: Flexible 2D and 3D camera controls
- **Resource Management**: Thread-safe resource handles and dependency tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and result-based error handling

### Rendering
- **OpenGL Renderer**: Modern OpenGL-based rendering pipeline
- **Batch Rendering**: Efficient batch rendering for 2D graphics
- **Shader System**: Flexible shader compilation and management
- **Texture Management**: Optimized texture loading and caching

### Debug & Development Tools
- **Debug Renderer**: Complete visualization API for debugging
- **Performance Profiler**: CPU/GPU timing and hierarchical profiling
- **Resource Tracker**: Memory leak detection and resource monitoring
- **Asset Dependencies**: Dependency graph with circular detection
- **Screenshot System**: High-quality screenshot capture

### Asset Management
- **Asset Manager**: Centralized asset loading and caching
- **Dependency Tracking**: Automatic dependency resolution
- **Circular Detection**: Prevents circular asset dependencies
- **Topological Sorting**: Optimized asset loading order

## Architecture

SilicaEngine follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
SilicaEngine/
â”œâ”€â”€ Core/           # Core engine systems
â”œâ”€â”€ Renderer/       # Graphics and rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ Debug/          # Development and debugging tools
â””â”€â”€ Fractura/       # Example application
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- OpenGL 4.3 or higher
- GLFW3
- GLM 1.0.1

### Building

#### Windows
```batch
scripts\windows\build-debug.bat
```

#### Linux
```bash
scripts/linux/build-debug.sh
```

#### macOS
```bash
scripts/macos/build-debug.sh
```

### Running the Example

The engine includes Fractura, a demonstration application showcasing engine capabilities:

```bash
scripts/windows/run-fractura.bat  # Windows
scripts/linux/run-fractura.sh     # Linux
scripts/macos/run-fractura.sh     # macOS
```
